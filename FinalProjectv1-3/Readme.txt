This is a basic alarm clock app, that enables user to set alarm to a specific time and receive a notification when the time has been reached.
It notifies the user via a ringtone and a notification that is displayed in the notification centre.
Moreover it provides the user with their weather data when they click on the notification to keep them updated about the weather conditions during the day when they wake up.


Initial vision:
Started working on adding navigation functionality as well so the user can set the location where they need to be when they woke up, thereby providing them with
traffic data so that they can plan their commute. Unfortunately it was not finished it time

Prominent bug:
Upon updating the android SDK version we were faced with an issue where a navigation pane/toolbar was added to the app unfortunately when working on removing it, we faced some issues

Referenced:
http://www.appsrox.com/android/tutorials
and used  stack overflow for error messages. 

To use: 
Run app
Once open click on 3 dot on right hand side
Add alarm clock: pick time. Pick repeat. 
     
Wait for notification! (selecting notification displays forecast weather)


or click on weather to see current weather and forecasted weather.

To do/fix:
* Edit navigation pane
*Get gps working as intended
*Edit saved alarms
* Alarm list gets deleted upon closing of the app however it will continue to ring on the days where repeat is set.
